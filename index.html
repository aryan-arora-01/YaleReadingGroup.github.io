                    <h4 class="red">Joshua Angrist, Eric Bettinger, Michael Kremer</h4>    
                        <p>Colombia's PACES program provided over 125,000 poor children with vouchers that covered the cost of private secondary school. The vouchers were renewable annually conditional on adequate academic progress. Since many vouchers were assigned by lottery, program effects can reliably be assessed by comparing lottery winners and losers. Estimates using administrative records suggest the PACES program increases secondary school completion rates by 15 to 20 percent. Correcting for the greater percentage of lottery winners taking college admissions tests, the program increased test scores by two-tenths of a standard deviation in the distribution of potential test scores.</p>

                    <h4 class="red">Barbara Biasi</h4>    
                        <p><b>Abstract:</b> Compensation of most US public school teachers is rigid and solely based on seniority. This paper studies the effects of a reform that gave school districts in Wisconsin full autonomy to redesign teacher pay schemes. Following the reform some districts switched to flexible compensation. Using the expiration of preexisting collective bargaining agreements as a source of exogenous variation in the timing of changes in pay, I show that the introduction of flexible pay raised salaries of high-quality teachers, increased teacher quality (due to the arrival of high-quality teachers from other districts and increased effort), and improved student achievement.</p>

                    <h4 class="red">Manasi Deshpande & Lee Lockwood</h4>    
                        <p><b>Abstract:</b> The public debate over disability insurance has centered on concerns about individuals without severe health conditions receiving benefits. We go beyond health risk alone to quantify the overall insurance value of U.S. disability programs, including value from insuring non-health risk. We find that disability recipients, especially those with less-severe health conditions, are much more likely to have experienced a wide variety of non-health shocks than non-recipients. Selection into disability receipt on the basis of non-health shocks is so strong among individuals with less-severe health conditions that by many measures less-severe recipients are worse off than more-severe recipients. As a result, under baseline assumptions, benefits to less-severe recipients have an annual surplus value (insurance benefit less efficiency cost) over cost-equivalent tax cuts of $7,700 per recipient, about three-fourths that of benefits to more-severe recipients ($9,900). Insurance against non-health risk accounts for about one-half of the value of U.S. disability programs.</p>

                    <h4 class="red">Amy Finkelstein, Nathaniel Hendren, and Mark Shepard</h4>    
                        <p><b>Abstract:</b> How much are low-income individuals willing to pay for health insurance, and what are the implications for insurance markets? Using administrative data from Massachusetts’ subsidized insurance exchange, we exploit discontinuities in the subsidy schedule to estimate willingness to pay and costs of insurance among low-income adults. As subsidies decline, insurance take-up falls rapidly, dropping about 25 percent for each $40 increase in monthly enrollee premiums. Marginal enrollees tend to be lower-cost, indicating adverse selection into insurance. But across the entire distribution we can observe (approximately the bottom 70 percent of the willingness to pay distribution) enrollees’ willingness to pay is always less than half of their own expected costs that they impose on the insurer. As a result, we estimate that take-up will be highly incomplete even with generous subsidies. If enrollee premiums were 25 percent of insurers’ average costs, at most half of potential enrollees would buy insurance; even premiums subsidized to 10 percent of average costs would still leave at least 20 percent uninsured. We briefly consider potential explanations for these findings and their normative implications.</p>

                <h4 class="red">John Eric Humphries, Winnie van Dijk, Aurelie Ouss, Kamelia Stavreva, and Megan Stevenson</h4>    
                    <p><b>Abstract:</b> We study the effects of conviction and incarceration on recidivism using quasi-random judge assignment. We extend the typical binary-treatment framework to a setting with multiple treatments, and outline a set of assumptions under which standard 2SLS regressions recover causal and margin-specific treatment effects. Under these assumptions, 2SLS regressions applied to data on felony cases in Virginia imply that conviction leads to a large and long-lasting increase in recidivism relative to dismissal, consistent with a criminogenic effect of a criminal record. In contrast, incarceration reduces recidivism, but only in the short run. The assumptions we outline could be considered restrictive in the random judge framework, ruling out some reasonable models of judge decision-making. Indeed, a key assumption is empirically rejected in our data. Nevertheless, after deriving an expression for the resulting asymptotic bias, we argue that the failure of this assumption is unlikely to overturn our qualitative conclusions. Finally, we propose and implement alternative identification strategies. Consistent with our characterization of the bias, these analyses yield estimates qualitatively similar to those based on the 2SLS estimates. Taken together, our results suggest that conviction is an important and potentially overlooked driver of recidivism, while incarceration mainly has shorter-term incapacitation effects.</p>

            <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4148813"> Gang Rule: Understanding and Countering Criminal Governance </a>
                <h4 class="red">Chistopher Blattman, Gustavo Duncan, Benjamin Lessing, and Santiago Tobon</h4>    
                    <p><b>Abstract:</b> Criminal groups govern millions worldwide. Even in strong states, gangs resolve disputes and provide security. Why do these duopolies of coercion emerge? In many cases, gangs fill vacuums of official order. If so, increasing state presence should crowd out criminal governance. In this paper, however, we show that state and gang rule are sometimes complements. In particular, gangs can deter state predation by keeping neighborhoods orderly and loyal. If true, increasing state presence could increase gang rule. We investigate in Medellín, Colombia. Criminal leaders told us they rule mainly to protect drug rents. We test gang responses to state presence using a geographic discontinuity. Internal border changes in 1987 assigned some blocks to be exogenously closer to state security for three decades. Gangs responded to closer state presence by increasing governance services, but primarily in neighborhoods with the greatest potential drug rents. This suggests new strategies for countering criminal governance.</p>

                <h4 class="red">Jingyi Qiu, Yan Chen, Alain Cohn, and Alvin Roth</h4>    
                    <p><b>Abstract:</b> Does new media promote accountability in nondemocratic countries, where offline media is often suppressed? We show that blog posts, which exposed corruption in Russian state-controlled companies, had a negative causal impact on their market returns. For identification, we exploit the precise timing of blog posts by looking at within-day results with company-day fixed effects. Furthermore, we show that the posts are ultimately associated with higher management turnover and less minority shareholder conflicts. Taken together, our results suggest that social media can discipline corruption even in a country with limited political competition and heavily censored traditional media.</p>

                <h4 class="red">Maria Micaela Sviatschi</h4>    
                    <p><b>Abstract:</b> This paper provides evidence that exposure to illegal labor markets during childhood leads to the formation of industry-specific human capital at an early age, putting children on a criminal life path. Using the timing of U.S. antidrug policies, I show that when the return to illegal activities increases in coca suitable areas in Peru, parents increase the use of child labor for coca farming, putting children on a criminal life path. Using administrative records, I show that affected children are about 30% more likely to be incarcerated for violent and drug-related crimes as adults. No effect in criminality is found for individuals that grow up working in places where the coca produced goes primarily to the legal sector, suggesting that it is the accumulation of human capital specific to the illegal industry that fosters criminal careers. However, the rollout of a conditional cash transfer program that encourages schooling mitigates the effects of exposure to illegal industries, providing further evidence on the mechanisms.</p>

                    <p><b>Abstract:</b> When is it possible for one person to persuade another to change her action? We consider a symmetric information model where a sender chooses a signal to reveal to a receiver, who then takes a noncontractible action that affects the welfare of both players. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a signal that strictly benefits the sender. We characterize sender-optimal signals. We examine comparative statics with respect to the alignment of the sender’s and the receiver’s preferences. Finally, we apply our results to persuasion by litigators, lobbyists, and salespeople.</p>

                <h4 class="red">Rebecca Diamond, Tim McQuade, and Franklin Qian</h4>    
                    <p><b>Abstract:</b> Using a 1994 law change, we exploit quasi-experimental variation in the assignment of rent control in San Francisco to study its impacts on tenants and landlords. Leveraging new data tracking individuals' migration, we find rent control limits renters' mobility by 20 percent and lowers displacement from San Francisco. Landlords treated by rent control reduce rental housing supplies by 15 percent by selling to owner-occupants and redeveloping buildings. Thus, while rent control prevents displacement of incumbent renters in the short run, the lost rental housing supply likely drove up market rents in the long run, ultimately undermining the goals of the law.</p>

            <a href="https://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/mariel-impact.pdf">The Impact of the Mariel Boatlift on the Miami Labor Market</a>
                <h4 class="red">David Card</h4>    
                    <p><b>Abstract:</b> Using data from the Current Population Survey, this paper describes the effect of the Mariel Boatlift of 1980 on the Miami labor market. The Mariel immigrants increased the Miami labor force by 7%, and the percentage increase in labor supply to less-skilled occupations and industries was even greater because most of the immigrants were relatively unskilled. Nevertheless, the Mariel influx appears to have had virtually no effect on the wages or unemployment rates of less-skilled workers, even among Cubans who had immigrated earlier. The author suggests that the ability of Miami's labor market to rapidly absorb the Mariel immigrants was largely owing to its adjustment to other large waves of immigrants in the two decades before the Mariel Boatlift.</p>

                <h4 class="red">Brian A. Jacob and Steven D. Levitt</h4>    
                    <p><b>Abstract:</b> We develop an algorithm for detecting teacher cheating that combines information on unexpected test score fluctuations and suspicious patterns of answers for students in a classroom. Using data from the Chicago public schools, we estimate that serious cases of teacher or administrator cheating on standardized tests occur in a minimum of 4–5 percent of elementary school classrooms annually. The observed frequency of cheating appears to respond strongly to relatively minor changes in incentives. Our results highlight the fact that high-powered incentive systems, especially those with bright line rules, may induce unexpected behavioral distortions such as cheating. Statistical analysis, however, may provide a means of detecting illicit acts, despite the best attempts of perpetrators to keep them clandestine.</p>

<h4 class="red">T. Terry Cheung, Shaowen Luo, Kwok Ping Tsang</h4>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> We investigate the persistent impact of data misreporting from China’s Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) on contemporary data quality in the country. We examine historical grain price data, collected monthly by Qing prefectural officials and reported to the central government. Using the absence of seasonal price fluctuations over extended periods as an indicator, we assess data quality. Employing an instrumental variable approach, we establish a causal link between data quality in the Qing Dynasty and data misreporting in modern China. Our findings indicate that a one-standard-deviation increase in Qing data quality corresponds to a 0.16 standard deviation increase in modern data quality. This result holds under various alternative specifications, even when the analysis is limited to frequently traded major crop types from the Qing Dynasty and when different periods of modern data quality are used. Moreover, we find that the persistence of data misreporting remains evident even in prefectures that have undergone significant changes in geographical attributes. We further suggest that this persistent pattern of data misreporting is primarily influenced by cultural factors rather than geographical ones.</p>

<h4 class="red">Tine De Moor and Jan Luiten Van Zanden</h4>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> This article argues that the European Marriage Pattern (EMP) has played a fundamental role in western Europe’s economic development. The EMP emerged in north-western Europe in the late medieval period as a result of the preaching of the Catholic Church promoting marriage based on consensus, the rise of labour markets, and specific institutions concerning property transfers between generations that encouraged wage labour by women. It resulted in a demographic regime embedded in a highly commercial environment, in which households interacted frequently with labour, capital, and commodity markets. We also discuss possible long-term consequences for human capital formation and institution building.</p>

<a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.32.1.3"> The Economic Implications of Housing Supply </a>
<h4 class="red">Edward Glaeser and Joseph Gyourko</h4>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> In this essay, we review the basic economics of housing supply and the functioning of US housing markets to better understand the distribution of home prices, household wealth, and the spatial distribution of people across markets. We employ a cost-based approach to gauge whether a housing market is delivering appropriately priced units. Specifically, we investigate whether market prices (roughly) equal the costs of producing the housing unit. If so, the market is well-functioning in the sense that it efficiently delivers housing units at their production cost. The gap between price and production cost can be understood as a regulatory tax. The available evidence suggests, but does not definitively prove, that the implicit tax on development created by housing regulations is higher in many areas than any reasonable negative externalities associated with new construction. We discuss two main effects of developments in housing prices: on patterns of household wealth and on the incentives for relocation to high-wage, high-productivity areas. Finally, we turn to policy implications.</p>

<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1527002517717299"> The Effects of Physical Activity on Social Interactions: The Case of Trust and Trustworthiness </a>
<h4 class="red">Giovanni Di Bartolomeo and Stefano Papa</h4>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> There is no doubt that physical activity improves health conditions; however, does it also affect the way people interact? Beyond the obvious effects related to team games, we wonder whether physical activity has in itself some effect on social behavior. Our research focuses on the potential effects of physical activity on trust and trustworthiness. Specifically, we compare the choices of subjects playing an investment game who were previously exposed to short-time physical activity to others who are not exposed to it, but involved in different simple tasks. On average, we find that subjects exposed to physical activity exhibit more trust and prosocial behaviors than those who are not exposed. These effects are not temporary.</p>

<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2951620"> Identification and Estimation of Local Average Treatment Effects </a>
<h4 class="red">Guido W. Imbens and Joshua D. Angrist</h4>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Random assignment of treatment and concurrent data collection on treatment and control groups is the norm in medical evaluation research. In contrast, the use of random assignment to evaluate social programs remains controversial. Following criticism of parametric evaluation models (e.g., Lalonde (1986)), econometric research has been geared towards establishing conditions that guarantee nonparametric identification of treatment effects in observational studies, i.e. identification without relying on functional form restrictions or distributional assumptions. The focus has been on identification of average treatment effects in a population of interest, or on the average effect for the subpopulation that is treated. The conditions required to nonparametrically identify these parameters can be restrictive, however, and the derived identification results fragile. In particular, results in Chamberlain (1986), Manski (1990), Heckman (1990), and Angrist and Imbens (1991) require that there be some subpopulation for whom the probability of treatment is zero, at least in the limit. The purpose of this paper is to show that even when there is no subpopulation available for whom the probability of treatment is zero, we can still identify an average treatment effect of interest under mild restrictions satisfied in a wide range of models and circumstances. We call this a local average treatment effect (LATE). Examples of problems where the local average treatment effect is identified include latent index models and evaluations based on natural experiments such as those studied by Angrist (1990) and Angrist and Krueger (1991). LATE is the average treatment effect for individuals whose treatment status is influenced by changing an exogenous regressor that satisfies an exclusion restriction.</p>

<a href="https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/banerjee92herd.pdf"> A Simple Model of Herd Behavior </a>
<h4 class="red">Abhijit V. Banerjee</h4>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> We analyze a sequential decision model in which each decision maker looks at the decisions made by previous decision makers in taking her own decision. This is rational for her because these other decision makers may have some information that is important for her. We then show that the decision rules that are chosen by optimizing individuals will be characterized by herd behavior; i.e., people will be doing what others are doing rather than using their information. We then show that the resulting equilibrium is inefficient.</p>

<a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20201540"> Spreading Gangs: Exporting US Criminal Capital to El Salvador </a>
<h4 class="red">Maria Micaela Sviatschi</h4>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> This paper shows how deportation policies can backfire by disseminating not only ideas between countries but also criminal networks, spreading gangs, in this case, across El Salvador, and spurring migration back to the United States. In 1996, the US Illegal Immigration Responsibility Act increased the number of criminal deportations. In particular, the members of large Salvadoran gangs developed in Los Angeles were sent back to El Salvador. Using variation in criminal deportations over time and across cohorts, combined with geographical variation in US gangs' location, I find that these deportations led to an increase in homicide rates and gang activity, as well as an increase in gang recruitment and migration of children.</p>

<a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20121637"> Trafficking Networks and the Mexican Drug War </a>
<h4 class="red">Melissa Dell</h4>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Drug trade-related violence has escalated dramatically in Mexico since 2007, and recent years have also witnessed large-scale efforts to combat trafficking, spearheaded by Mexico's conservative PAN party. This study examines the direct and spillover effects of Mexican policy toward the drug trade. Regression discontinuity estimates show that drug-related violence increases substantially after close elections of PAN mayors. Empirical evidence suggests that the violence reflects rival traffickers' attempts to usurp territories after crackdowns have weakened incumbent criminals. Moreover, the study uses a network model of trafficking routes to show that PAN victories divert drug traffic, increasing violence along alternative drug routes. (JEL D72, D85, K42, O17, Z13)</p>
