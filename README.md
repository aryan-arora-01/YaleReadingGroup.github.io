##### Emir Kamenica and Matthew Gentzkow

<b> Abstract: </b> When is it possible for one person to persuade another to change her action? We consider a symmetric information model where a sender chooses a signal to reveal to a receiver, who then takes a noncon- tractible action that affects the welfare of both players. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a signal that strictly benefits the sender. We characterize sender-optimal signals. We examine comparative statics with respect to the alignment of the sender’s and the receiver’s preferences. Finally, we apply our results to persuasion by litigators, lobbyists, and salespeople.

##### David Card

<b> Abstract: </b> Using data from the Current Population Survey, this paper describes the effect of the Marie1Boatlift of 1980on the Miami labor market. The Marie1 immigrants increased the Miami labor force by 7%, and the percentage increase in labor supply to less-skilled occupations and industries was even greater because most of the immigrants were relatively unskilled. Nevertheless, the Marie1 influx appears to have had virtually no effect on the wages or unemployment rates of less-skilled workers, even among Cubans who had immigrated earlier. The author suggests that the ability of Miami's labor market to rapidly absorb the Marie1 immigrants was largely owing to its adjustment to other lar

##### Shengwu Li

<b> Abstract: </b> Which mechanisms are simple to play? When is it easy for participants to see that a mechanism is incentive-compatible? I will start by explaining how and why economists came to ask these questions. Then I will discuss three recent answers, that capture different aspects of what makes a mechanism simple.

##### Robert J. Aumann

<b> Abstract: </b> Two people, 1 and 2, are said to have common knowledge of an event E if both know it, 1 knows that 2 knows it, 2 knows that 1 knows is, 1 knows that 2 knows that 1 knows it, and so on. THEOREM. If two people have the same priors, and their posteriors for an event A are common knowledge, then these posteriors are equal.

##### Brian A. Jacob and Steven D. Levitt

<b> Abstract: </b> We develop an algorithm for detecting teacher cheating that combines information on unexpected test score fluctuations and suspicious patterns of answers for students in a classroom. Using data from the Chicago public schools, we estimate that serious cases of teacher or administrator cheating on standardized tests occur in a minimum of 4–5 percent of elementary school classrooms annually. The observed frequency of cheating appears to respond strongly to relatively minor changes in incentives. Our results highlight the fact that high-powered incentive systems, especially those with bright line rules, may induce unexpected behavioral distortions such as cheating. Statistical analysis, however, may provide a means of detecting illicit acts, despite the best attempts of perpetrators to keep them clandestine.

## Suggestions of More Technical Papers:

#### <a href= "https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/cs286r/courses/spring07/papers/myerson.pdf"> Optimal Auction Design </a>
##### Roger B. Myerson

<b> Abstract: </b> This paper considers the problem faced by a seller who has a singie object to sell to one of several possible buyers, when the seller has imperfect information about how much the buyers might be willing to pay for the object. The seller's problem is to design an auction game which has a Nash equilibrium giving him the highest possible expected utility. Optimal auctions are derived in this paper for a wide class of auction design problems.


#### <a href= "https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr08/cos444/papers/myerson_satterthwaite83.pdf"> Efficient Mechanisms for Bilateral Trading </a>
##### Roger B. Myerson and Mark A. Satterthwaite

<b> Abstract: </b> We consider bargaining problems between one buyer and one seller for a single object. The seller’s valuation and the buyer’s valuation for the object are assumed to be independent random variables, and each individual’s valuation is unknown to the other. We characterize the set of allocation mechanisms that are Bayesian incentive compatible and individually rational, and show the general impossibility of ex post efficient mechanisms without outside subsidies. For a wide class of problems we show how to compute mechanisms that maximize expected total gains from trade, and mechanisms that can maximize a broker’s expected profit.

##### Vincent P. Crawford and Joel Sobel

<b> Abstract: </b> This paper develops a model of strategic communication, in which a better-informed Sender (S) sends a possibly noisy signal to a Receiver (R), who then takes an action that determines the welfare of both. We characterize the set of Bayesian Nash equilibria under standard assumptions, and show that equilibrium signaling always takes a strikingly simple form, in which S partitions the support of the (scalar) variable that represents his private information and introduces noise into his signal by reporting, in effect, only which element of the partition his observation actually lies in. We show under further assumptions that before S observes his private information, the equilibrium whose partition has the greatest number of elements is Pareto-superior to all other equilibria, and that if agents coordinate on this equilibrium, R's equilibrium expected utility rises when agents' preferences become more similar. Since R bases his choice of action on rational expectations, this establishes a sense in which equilibrium signaling is more informative when agents' preferences are more similar.


#### <a href= "https://academic.oup.com/restud/article-abstract/71/1/165/1589950?redirectedFrom=fulltext"> Committee Design with Endogenous Information </a>
##### Nicola Persico

<b> Abstract: </b> Identical agents gather costly information, and then aggregate it through voting. Because information is a public good, information is underprovided relative to the social optimum. A “good” voting rule must give incentives to acquire information, as well as aggregate information efficiently. A voting rule that requires a large plurality (in the extreme, unanimity) to upset the status quo can be optimal only if the information available to each agent is sufficiently accurate. This result is independent of the preferences of voters and of the cost of information.

#### <a href= "https://www.jstor.org/stable/2951613"> Renegotiation Design with Unverifiable Information </a>
#####  Philippe Aghion, Mathias Dewatripoint, and Patrick Rey

<b> Abstract: </b> This paper considers a buyer-seller relationship with observable but unverifiable investments and/or random utility parameters. In such situations, it is known that contract renegotiation may prevent the implementation of first-best outcomes. In this paper, we show however that efficient investments and optimal risk-sharing can typically be achieved provided the initial contract is able to monitor the ex post renegotiation process. Specifically, we focus on the following two features of renegotiation design. First, default options in case renegotiation breaks down; second, the allocation of all bargaining power to either contracting party. Moreover, we show that these two features can be obtained in standard Rubinstein bargaining games through contractual provisions, such as specific-performance clauses and penalties for delay (or, equivalently, financial "hostages" refundable without interest)

#### <a href= "https://jstor.org/stable/2555911"> Option contracts and renegotiation: a solution to the hold-up problem </a>
#####  Georg Nöldeke and Klaus M. Schmidt

<b> Abstract: </b> In this article, we analyze the canonical hold-up model of Hart and Moore under the assumption that the courts can verify delivery of the good by the seller. It is shown that no further renegotiation design is necessary to achieve the first best: simple option contracts, which give the seller the right to take the delivery decision and specify payments depending on whether delivery takes place, allow implementation of efficient investment decisions and efficient trade.

#### <a href= "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.03579"> Mechanism Design with Limited Commitment* </a>
#####  Laura Doval and Vasiliki Skreta

<b> Abstract: </b> We develop a tool akin to the revelation principle for dynamic mechanism-selection
games in which the designer can only commit to short-term mechanisms. We identify a canonical class of mechanisms rich enough to replicate the outcomes of any equilibrium in a mechanism-selection game between an uninformed designer and a privately informed agent. A cornerstone of our methodology is the idea that a mechanism should encode not only the rules that determine the allocation, but also the information the designer obtains from the interaction with the agent. Therefore, how much the designer learns, which is the key tension in design with limited commitment, becomes an explicit part of the design. Our result simplifies the search for the designer-optimal outcome by reducing the agent’s behavior to a series of participation, truthtelling, and
Bayes’ plausibility constraints the mechanisms must satisfy.

#####  : S. Rao Aiyagari 

<b> Abstract: </b> We present a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the standard growth model modified to include precautionary saving motives and liquidity constraints. We address the impact on the aggregate saving rate, the importance of asset trading to individuals, and the relative inequality of wealth and income distributions.

#### <a href= "https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~xgabaix/papers/granular.pdf"> The Granular Origins of Aggregate Fluctuations </a>
#####  : Xavier Gabaix 

<b> Abstract: </b> This paper proposes that idiosyncratic firm-level shocks can explain an important
part of aggregate movements and provide a microfoundation for aggregate shocks. Existing research has focused on using aggregate shocks to explain business cycles, arguing that individual firm shocks average out in the aggregate. I show that this argument breaks down if the distribution of firm sizes is fat-tailed, as documented empirically. The idiosyncratic movements of the largest 100 firms in the United States appear to explain about one-third of variations in output growth. This “granular” hypothesis suggests new directions for macroeconomic research, in particular that macroeconomic questions can be clarified by looking at the behavior of large firms. This paper’s ideas and analytical results may also be useful for thinking about the fluctuations of other
economic aggregates, such as exports or the trade balance
