#### ROTTEN APPLES: AN INVESTIGATION OF THE PREVALENCE AND PREDICTORS OF TEACHER CHEATING (BRIAN A. JACOB AND STEVEN D. LEVITT)

We develop an algorithm for detecting teacher cheating that combines infor- mation on unexpected test score uctuations and suspicious patterns of answers for students in a classroom. Using data from the Chicago public schools, we estimate that serious cases of teacher or administrator cheating on standardized tests occur in a minimum of 4–5 percent of elementary school classrooms annu- ally. The observed frequency of cheating appears to respond strongly to relatively minor changes in incentives. Our results highlight the fact that high-powered incentive systems, especially those with bright line rules, may induce unexpected behavioral distortions such as cheating. Statistical analysis, however, may pro- vide a means of detecting illicit acts, despite the best attempts of perpetrators to keep them clandestine.
